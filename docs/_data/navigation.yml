  - title: Python-Porting-Challenge
    description: "This challenge focuses on enabling Python support for Windows on\
      \ Arm (WoA) to improve developer experience. While Python is widely used in\
      \ research and industry, many popular packages\u2014such as Pandas\u2014still\
      \ lack pre-built WoA binaries (win_arm64 wheels). The goal is to validate and\
      \ optimise third-party packages, fix compatibility issues, and collaborate with\
      \ maintainers to upstream WoA support."
