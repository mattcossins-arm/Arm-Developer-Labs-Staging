## Description

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is the de facto standard compiler for Haskell, an advanced purely functional programming language with strong type inference and lazy evaluation. This project aims to **port GHC cto support Windows on Arm (WoA)**, a platform that is increasingly relevant with the rise of Arm-powered laptops and developer kits. Request for support has [previously been requested by the community](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24603)

Currently, GHC lacks robust support for WoA, hindering Haskell’s reach in energy-efficient and mobile-native environments. The goal is to bridge this gap by:
- Enabling native compilation of Haskell code via GHC on WoA.
- Implementing and testing architecture-specific assembly and intrinsic functions.
- Extending the GHC build system to recognize WoA environments.
- Integrating and validating linker and runtime support on Arm-based Windows systems.

The project requires in-depth familiarity with compiler backends, calling conventions, code generation pipelines, and the use of LLVM or native code generators. Students will also gain experience in cross-compilation, Windows PE/COFF linking, and performance benchmarking on Arm CPUs.

The work has potential for real-world deployment and academic publishing, and would be of high value to the Haskell and Arm developer ecosystems.
