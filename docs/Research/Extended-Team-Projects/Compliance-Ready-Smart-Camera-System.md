### Project Difficulty  
Challenging

Reach out to Arm at [education@arm.com](mailto:education@arm.com) if you'd like to participate in this challenge.

### Target Audience  
Industry or academia.

## Description  
Government and external regulations, particularly in automotive industries, are shaping how smart camera products are designed, implemented, and verified. This project will explore how compliance with standards like ISO 26262 influences the design of smart camera systems, such as Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) to ensure driver attentiveness. Students or engineers will collaborate with industry-relevant platforms, such as Arm's Kronos Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) for automotive development, to understand and propose frictionless developer experiences aligned with functional safety standards.

Deliverables include:
- Developing a full end-to-end smart camera system that can be incorporated into a functional safety environment (such as automotive or medical), following the relevant standards for development (e.g., ISO 26262)
- A survey of regulatory requirements and their impact on smart camera design
- An architectural analysis integrating Arm-based systems into a compliant automotive software stack
- Recommendations for enhancing developer tools and reference software stacks to align with ISO standards

## Estimated Project Duration  
- Estimated Time: 6+ months  
- Participants: Team of 2+

## Resources
