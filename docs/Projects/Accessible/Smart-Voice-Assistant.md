### Project Difficulty
Very difficult

## Description
This undergraduate project aims to develop a simple voice assistant that can recognize spoken commands such as “turn on the light,” “play music,” and other similar tasks. The voice assistant will be able to control peripheral devices accordingly. The main objective is to implement your design on a low-power microcontroller Cortex-M55/U55 to create low-level machine learning applications. You should look to access metrics such as the accuracy, power and computation time. Please refer our [Machine Learning keyword spotting example](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/mlek-cmsis-pack-examples) as a reference. 

The deliverables include a functional voice assistant capable of understanding and executing basic commands, along with documentation detailing the development process and the performance of the system.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8 to 12 weeks to complete, making it perfect for a semester-long project. It can be undertaken by a small team of 2-3 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, C++, Embedded C
- Tooling: TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, Keil MDK
- Hardware: Cortex-M55/U55 development board (or Corstone Virtual Platform), microphone, peripheral devices (e.g., lights, speakers)
