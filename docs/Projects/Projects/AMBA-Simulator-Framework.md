## Audience
Electronic Engineering

## Description
This project aims to develop a reference design of AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) infrastructure. You are free to choose which AMBA protocol and version of the interconnect standard to implement with more simple specifications e.g., APB, being easier to create than coherent protocols such as AMBA CHI. 

The main deliverables include the Verilog design of the AMBA infrastructure, a Verilog test bench for testing the design, an RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulation flow to verify the functionality, and an FPGA prototyping platform to demonstrate the design in a real-world environment. The project will provide a comprehensive understanding of AMBA protocols and their implementation, making it an excellent learning opportunity for students interested in digital design and hardware description languages.

## Hardware, Software and Skills Required

- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: ModelSim, Quartus, Vivado
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), simulation tools
