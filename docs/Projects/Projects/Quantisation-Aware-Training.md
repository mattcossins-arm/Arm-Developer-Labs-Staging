title: 'Quantization-Aware Training for Mobile Deployment: Deploying Lightweight Models
  on Arm'
---

## Description  

This open-ended project invites students to explore **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** with PyTorch to optimize computer vision models for **Arm-based mobile devices** (e.g., Android smartphones).

The project centers on training a model using a **non-restrictively licensed dataset** and deploying it either on **Arm-powered mobile devices** (leveraging Android Neural Networks API )

Students will apply QAT to maintain accuracy while reducing model size and inference latency, making it suitable for real-time applications like:
- Sign language recognition for accessibility.
- Visual anomaly detection in manufacturing.
- Personal health and activity monitoring from camera feeds.

The project encourages referencing work by contributing **optimized and quantized models for Arm platforms** on HuggingFace. The final quantized model will be **uploaded to HuggingFace** and may be submitted for listing in the [Arm on HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/Arm), encouraging open, community-supported contributions.

## Hardware, Software and Skills Required

- **Languages**: Familiar with Python, pytorch and Java/Kotlin (if Android).
- **Frameworks**: Intermediate understanding of PyTorch 
- **Tooling**: PyTorch Lightning, Android Studio 
- **Hardware Options**:  
  - Android phone with Arm Cortex-A CPU or simulator through Android Studio. 
- **Deployment Targets**:  
  - Android
