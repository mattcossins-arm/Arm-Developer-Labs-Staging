  ## Description
  This project aims to leverage the Corstone-1000 platform to host and support a custom research accelerator. The main deliverables include prototyping the accelerator in FPGA and then creating a physical silicon implementation using a pre-verified programmable control system. The project will provide practical experience in SoC design, FPGA prototyping, and hardware acceleration. The final output will be a functional SoC FPGA prototyping platform with DDR memory, capable of running Linux and demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the design. **To undertake this project, please reach out to SoC Labs** in [this link](https://soclabs.org/).


  ## Prequisites

  - Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
  - Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, ASIC design tools
  - Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Corstone-1000 platform
  - IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

  ## Resources from Arm and our partners

  - External Community: [SoC Labs, community for Arm-based software development](https://soclabs.org/)

  ## Support Level

  This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

  ## Benefits 

  Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

  To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
