  ## Description
  This project aims to develop a real-time image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on an Arm Cortex-M microcontroller with CMSIS-NN. The main deliverables include training a CNN model on a custom dataset, quantizing the model to deploy it on resource-constrained devices, and transforming the model into a C format to compile and run on the microcontroller. The project will provide practical experience in running AI models on edge devices and optimizing AI models for efficient performance. The final output will be a functional image classification system capable of real-time processing on a microcontroller.


  ## Prequisites

  - Languages: Python, ML framework experience (TensorFlowLite for microcontroller or Pytorch / Executorch), Embedded programming in C. 
  - Tooling: 
      - TensorFlow Lite
      - CMSIS-NN
      - Keil MDK
  - Hardware: 
      - Arm Cortex-M based microcontroller development board and compatible camera module. 
      - Access to hardware suitable for training neural networks

  ## Resources from Arm and our partners

  - Learning paths: [Tutorials on CMSIS](https://learn.arm.com/tag/cmsis/)
  - Install Guide: [Keil Studio for VSCode](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/keilstudio_vs/)
  - Book: ["A beginner's Guide to Designing Embedded System Applications on Arm Cortex-M Microcontrollers"](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/books)
  - Book: ["Arm Helium Technology M-Profile Vector Extensions (MVE)"](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/books)

  ## Support Level

  This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).


  ## Benefits 

  Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

  To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
