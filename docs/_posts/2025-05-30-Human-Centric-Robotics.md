title: Human-Centric Robotics – Urban Deployment & Socioeconomic Modelling
description: This team project will build and test an Arm-based urban service robot—merging real-time navigation, vision-guided manipulation, and human interaction—and model its socioeconomic impact to show how Arm platforms can transform last-mile delivery, eldercare, or other city services.

  ## Description

  **Why this is important?**

  Arm is transitioning from traditional IP to providing platforms for the AI era, please see a recent [news post](https://newsroom.arm.com/news/new-arm-product-naming-architecture) for more details. This project is crucial for Arm as it showcases the versatility of Arm-based platforms in real-world applications, enhancing their relevance in the robotics sector.  Furthermore, the insights gained from this project can inform future developments and partnerships and share future platforms related to robotics.

  **Project Summary**

  This project challenges students to design, build, and evaluate a human-centric robotic system for urban deployment using Arm-based compute platforms such as Raspberry Pi 5, NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, etc. The primary focus is on deploying prototypes in a controlled campus environment for applications like last-mile delivery, eldercare assistance, or smart waste collection.


  Participants will integrate real-time navigation, object manipulation, and human-interaction modules using state-of-the-art computer vision and sensor fusion frameworks. The second phase involves simulating or evaluating the robot’s impact on urban workflows and labor markets, including surveys or socioeconomic modeling techniques (e.g., system dynamics or agent-based simulation).

  Potential Deliverables include:
  - A working prototype running on an Arm-based platform
  - Software stack (navigation, ML inference, interaction logic)
  - Field evaluation results & UX data (e.g., survey or usage logs)
  - Report of development process and considerations when prototyping an end-user product.
  - A socioeconomic impact report using modeling or simulation techniques

  *Note: Arm does not offer direct channels to municipalities or public testing environments. Projects should focus on campus deployments, simulated environments (e.g., Gazebo).*

  ## Estimated Project Duration

  6+ months  
  Team size: 2+ participants  

  ## Prerequisites

  - **Languages**: Familiarity with an OOP language. 
  - **Hardware**:
  - **IP/Cloud Access**:
    - Any cloud service provider with Arm-based instances (for model training or data analysis)

  ## Benefits 

  Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

  To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
