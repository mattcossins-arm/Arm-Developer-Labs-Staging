## Description  

This open-ended project invites students to explore **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** with PyTorch to optimize computer vision models for **Arm-based mobile devices** (e.g., Android smartphones).

The project centers on training a model using a **non-restrictively licensed dataset** and deploying it either on **Arm-powered mobile devices** (leveraging Android Neural Networks API )

Students will apply QAT to maintain accuracy while reducing model size and inference latency, making it suitable for real-time applications like:
- Sign language recognition for accessibility.
- Visual anomaly detection in manufacturing.
- Personal health and activity monitoring from camera feeds.

The project encourages referencing work by contributing **optimized and quantized models for Arm platforms** on HuggingFace. The final quantized model will be **uploaded to HuggingFace** and may be submitted for listing in the [Arm on HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/Arm), encouraging open, community-supported contributions.

## Prequisites

- **Languages**: Familiar with Python, pytorch and Java/Kotlin (if Android).
- **Frameworks**: Intermediate understanding of PyTorch 
- **Tooling**: PyTorch Lightning, Android Studio 
- **Hardware Options**:  
  - Android phone with Arm Cortex-A CPU or simulator through Android Studio. 
- **Deployment Targets**:  
  - Android  

## Resources from Arm and our partners

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
