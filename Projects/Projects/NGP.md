## Description

### Why is this important?

Arm neural technology is an industry first, adding dedicated neural accelerators to Arm GPUs, bringing PC-quality, AI powered graphics to mobile for the first time – and laying the foundation for future on-device AI innovation. 

Developers can start building now with the industry’s first open development kit for neural graphics with an Unreal Engine plugin, emulators, and open models on GitHub and Hugging Face. 

[Arm Neural Technology Announcement](https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-announces-arm-neural-technology)

Neural Super Sampling (NSS) is Arm’s mobile-optimized AI-driven graphics upscaler that improves image quality while lowering resolution. It builds on a prior Arm solution: Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR). It is supported by an Unreal Engine plugin, streamlining its use as part of a typical industry games development process.

Future SDK support will be provided for Neural Frame Rate Upscaling (NFRU) - so feel free to extend this project using NFRU when released.

### Project Summary

Create a small game scene utilising the Arm Neural Graphics UE plugin to demonstrate:
- **Near-identical visuals at lower resolution** (render low → upscale with NSS)  

Document your progress and findings and consider alternative applications of the neural technology within games development.

Attempt different environments and objects. For example:

- Daytime vs night
- Urban city, jungle forest, ocean floor, alien planet, building interiors
- Complex lighting and shadows
- NPCs with detailed clothing, faces, hair. Include animations.

Make your scenes dynamic with particle effects, shadows, physics and motion.

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in digital badges for CV building, recognised by Arm Talent Acquisition. We are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.


To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
