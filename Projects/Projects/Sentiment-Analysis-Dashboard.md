## Description
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis dashboard for keywords related to the semiconductor industry. The main deliverable is a web scraping script that gathers text data from various semiconductor news sites. Example sites are [SemiconductorEngineering.com](https://semiengineering.com/), [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/), [EETimes](https://www.eetimes.com/tag/semiconductors/), [SemiconductorDigest](https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/), [SemiconductorToday](https://semiconductor-today.com/), [Financial Times - Semiconductors](https://www.ft.com/semiconductors), [Bezinga Semiconductors](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/semiconductors).

This data will then be processed through a sentiment analysis LLM (Large Language Model) to determine the sentiment of the content and how it varies over time. The project will provide practical experience in web scraping, data processing, databases and using LLMs for sentiment analysis. The final output will be a functional dashboard that displays the sentiment analysis results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Prequisites

- Languages: Intermediate understanding of Python
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity and access to cloud instances

## Resources from Arm and our partners

You are free to choose your own implementation details. The resouces below are examples to get started. 

- External Documentation:  [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) 
- Learning Paths: [Deploy MariaDB](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/mariadb/)


## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).


## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
