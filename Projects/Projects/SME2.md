## Description

### Why is this important?

SME2 (Scalable Matrix Extension 2) is the latest CPU extension on Arm Lumex CSS. Designed to accelerate matrix-oriented compute workloads directly on device, SME2 improves AI/ML performance. This is by accelerating models that rely on operations like matrix multiplication, common in transformers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and large language models (LLMs). Via KleidiAI, SME2 is seamlessly integrated into frameworks such as ExecuTorch, LiteRT, ONNX Runtime so it is automatically leveraged for applications depending on whether SME2 is present on the host device.

The vivo X300 is built on Arm Lumex. SME2 now enables AI compute that previously was too heavy or inaccessible on mobile. Developers can now utilise these advancements to deliver advanced applications on-device, reducing latency, increasing data privacy, and unlocking novel use-cases.

### Project Summary

Select a **mobile edge AI application** that benefits from large matrix operations, multi-modal fusion, or transformer-based processing enabled by SME2. Build and optimize a proof-of-concept application on a vivo X300 phone or other device supporting SME2.

Example project areas:  
    - Real-time video semantic segmentation (e.g., background removal + AR compositing)  
    - Live object detection + natural-language description (text summary of what the camera sees)  
    - Multi-sensor fusion (camera + IMU + microphone) for gesture + voice recognition  
    - On-device lightweight LLM or encoder-only transformer processing for mobile assistants  

Identify a model architecture that maps to wide matrix operations (e.g., ViT, MLP-Mixer, multi-branch CNN with large FC layers). Utilise a mobile-friendly framework (e.g., ExecuTorch, LiteRT, ONNX Runtime, MediaPipe) to leverage SME2 optimizations. Optimize quantization, memory layout, and verify that the large matrix multiplications get scheduled efficiently on the SME2-enabled CPU. Build a mobile app (Android) that executes the model and utilises it for a compelling use-case.

Utilise the resources and learning paths below and create an exciting and challenging application. Optionally, you could also compare performance vs a reference phone without SME2.

## Support Level

This project is designed to be self-serve but comes with opportunity of some community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of the Arm Developer program. If you are not already part of our program, [click here to join](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register).

## Benefits 

Standout project contributions will result in digital badges for CV building, recognised by Arm Talent Acquisition. We are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us.


To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.
